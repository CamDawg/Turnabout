# Turnabout
Summon old friends for the final ToB battle! Ascension mod required.

Ascension, created by David Gaider and members of the IEEAIS group, is both among the first and the best-known Baldur's Gate 2 mods. By altering the Throne of Bhaal endgame to what the authors said more closely mirrored the original Bioware plan, Ascension allowed the TOB villain to call up the player's fallen enemies for one final showdown. It also gave the PC expanded Bhaal essence powers. Yet the player was still denied an equal privilege to bring back fallen allies to join in the fray.

Through this mod, the player gains a limited ability to mimic the actions of the mad high priestess of Bhaal. When each of Throne essence pools is disrupted, the player can choose to recall one fallen ally from a selected list of characters from Baldur's Gate 1 and 2, for a maximum of three. In much the same way as the character granted new life to Sarevok in the beginning of TOB, and could choose to do so for Bodhi in exchange for her service in Ascension, the PC can offer the same boon to one of the Turnabout allies.
